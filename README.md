### Minecraft Advanced Score Calculation

This script is used to read directly from a scoreboard file for a Minecraft world, pull score values, and perform more advanced mathematical operations on the score value than is usually permitted in-game.


The script was originally developed by students for a Minecraft LAN Party hosted by the MCC Computer Club.
